# Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025 Submission

## Project: Netflix Website Replication + New Features

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project is a **pixel-perfect replication** of the **Netflix** web interface, built for the Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025.

In addition to replicating the core design and layout with precision (fonts, spacing, colors, and responsiveness), I have **introduced several new features** to enhance user experience and functionality.
